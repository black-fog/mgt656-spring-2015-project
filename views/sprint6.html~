<h1> Progress </h1>
During our sixth and last sprint, we were able to finish all of the stories 
in our product backlog and pass all of the required tests. You can view our 
updated backlog at <a href="https://waffle.io/black-fog/mgt656-spring-2015-project"> here. </a>
<p></p>
We had one scrum meeting in this week. Since that was our last sprint meeting, we started to discuss 
the possibility of technical issues that could prevent us to complete the project before final report. 
Our coders convinced us this would not be the case and they would be able to complete all of the stories 
in the product backlog. Then we talked about the sprint 5 and why RSVP for event story placed in sprint backlog. 
The common answer was time constraints. Then we talked about scrum master and her role in final sprint. Since sprint 6 
is the most important sprint her role was so crucial to help the team finish all stories in line with agile/scrum principles. 
She did very well in sprint 6 and team was able to complete all of the stories very fast and correct.

As of now there are no errors or bugs in our web page. It is fully functional: API and filtering mechanism to 
block non Yale addresses was written, google analytics was implemented and users are able to RSVP. We generously 
invite you to look at our <a href="http://mgt656-black-fog.herokuapp.com/">home page </a>. User can navigate wherever 
she wants (create an event sections, events section and about page). Users are able to create a new event through our 
<a href=" http://mgt656-black-fog.herokuapp.com/events/new "> create a new event page</a>.  
They have to determine the title, location, associated image and specific date and time. Also they can see lists of events on 
our home page or on our <a href="http://mgt656-black-fog.herokuapp.com/events">events page</a> and 
when they click on the event they move to the  <a href=" http://mgt656-black-fog.herokuapp.com/events/0">event information page</a>. 
Here they can see who will attend to the event or they can subscribe by submitting their Yale email address.
