<h1> Progress </h1>
During our third sprint, we were able to make significant progress with our project. 
We finished incorporation with Bootstrap and completed the Home Page
 with the requested components: logo, list with titles, and a footer
 that contains a link to the “About” page. We are happy to report that
 we were able to resolve our prior communication issues and have agreed
 upon a plan for future project coordination. By the end of the meeting,
 we successfully discussed project progress and created goals
 for the next sprint. 
For sprint 4, we plan on continuing to work through our Product Backlog
. We plan on completing
 items 1, 2, 3, and 4 by our next sprint. We believe that with our improved
 communication and project processes in place, our coding and sprint reports 
will flow more smoothly with increased understanding by all team members. We
 are also happy to announce that our sprint reports, starting from
 report #3, will be shown in our web page.
